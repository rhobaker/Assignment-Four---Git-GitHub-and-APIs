    <h1>The .gitignore file</h1>
    <p>The .gitignore file contains all of the files and folders that you want Git to ignore in the repository.</p>

    <h2>How to create the file</h2>
    <p>The file is created in a plain text file and has to be called .gitignore.txt.</p>
    <p>It contains a list of all the files and folders that you want Git to ignore and not track in the repository.</p>
    <p>Each additional file that you want to ignore should be on a new line.</p>
    <p>The lines in the file can also use symbols to create matching patterns.</p>
    <p>e.g. * is a wildcard match.</p>
    <p># can be used to add comments to explain the lines in the file.</p>

    <h2>Example lines:</h2>
    <p># Ignore Mac system files</p>
    <p>.DS_store</p>

    <p># Ignore all text files</p>
    <p>*.txt</p>


    <h2>How to add .gitignore.txt</h2>
    <p>The text file should be saved into the root directory of the Git folder.</p>
    <p>To create the file, navigate to the root directory in the terminal and use the command:</p>
    <p>touch .gitignore</p>
    <p>You can then open the file \(remember it will be hidden\) and add a list of the files you want to ignore.</p>
