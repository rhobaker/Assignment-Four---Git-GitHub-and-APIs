# This repositiory contains revision notes for the Git and GitHub topics of the CFGDegree

## <u>All about me</u>
I am currently studying for the CFGDegree in the Spring cohort.\
I have already completed projects in JavaScript, Pyhton and mySQL.\
My current project is about Git and GitHub.
I am also working on one using APIs in Flask.

## <u>Project Description</u>
This project is designed to provide a concise set of revision notes about Git and GitHub.\
It takes all the ***stress*** out of reviewing these topics in a easy to read set of notes.

## <u>Formats used</u>
The Markdown notes file is in the *markdown* format and can be viewed directly in GitHub, by clicking on the file.\
The other files are in *HTML* format and can be viewed by opening them in a browser.\
They are linked to a *CSS* style sheet to provide details of the formatting - both files will be needed.

## <u>How to use the notes</u>
The files are:
```
Git and GitHub notes
Markdown notes
README notes
```

The best way to use the notes is to start with **"Git and GitHub notes"** and then move on to **"Markdown notes"** and finally the **"README notes."**
