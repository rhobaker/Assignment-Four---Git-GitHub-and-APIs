# This repositiory contains revision notes for the Git and GitHub topics of the CFGDegree

## <u>All about me</u>
I am currently studying for the CFGDegree in the Spring cohort.\
I have already completed projects in JavaScript, Python and mySQL.\
My current project is about Git and GitHub.
I am also working on a project using APIs in Flask.

## <u>Project Description</u>
This project is designed to provide a concise set of revision notes about Git and GitHub.\
It takes all the ***stress*** out of reviewing these topics in a easy to read set of notes.

## <u>Formats used</u>
The Markdown notes file is in the *markdown* format and can be viewed directly in GitHub, by clicking on the file.\
The other files are in *HTML* format and can be viewed by opening them in a browser.

## <u>How to use the notes</u>
The files are:
```
Git and GitHub notes
Markdown notes
README notes
Requirements notes
gitignore notes
```

The best order to use the notes in is to start with **"Git and GitHub notes"** and then move on to **"Markdown notes"** and finally the **"README notes."**  The **Requirements notes** and the **gitignore notes** can be used as stand alone files.

## <u>Demonstration of Git and GitHub</u>
As part of my project, I have to demonstrate the use of Git and GitHub.\
Screen shot links showing my use of both are detailed below, or can be accessed in the "Screen Shots" folder in the repository:
